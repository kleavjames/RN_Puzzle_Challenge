# Puzzle Challenge

This challenge is designed to help us understand how you write code, utilise libraries. The execution is intentionally open and there's no one right way to solve it.

## Objective

Create a tile puzzle interface that consists of a frame divided into even tiles with one tile missing. These tiles should then be randomised so that user interaction is required to resolve the original frame. Tiles may only be moved into the empty position.

You can spend as long as you'd like, though we recommend not more than 8 hours - partial submissions with 'known issues' covering approaches and relevant notes are ok.

### Technology Requirement

- React Native
- Redux
- Redux Saga

### Optional Technology

- Reselect
- TypeScript

### Criteria

- Candidate must use React Native, Redux, and Redux Saga to complete the challenge
- Reselect and Typescript is optional but strongly reconmmended
- Code quality (includes elegance, consistency & readability)
- Usability (operates without error and responsive to browser/device)
- Reusability (bonus points for any reusable elements)
